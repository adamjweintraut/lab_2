# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Motivation
Movies have been in existence since 1888. Since then, watching movies has been one of our favorite pastimes. Movies are a form of blending visual and sound communication to tell a vivid story. 

The movie entertainment industry is a high profile multi-billion-dollar global industry. The movie industry has exponentially grown over the past decades. With this growth there has come a windfall of revenue generating profits. As technology evolves and enhances the viewing experience, you can watch movies from various devices. People can enjoy movies in the comfort of their homes or while traveling. 

The ability to predict movie revenue can be a very insightful opportunity. With the predicted revenue information, movie makers can intelligently plan their movie budget. Movie budget line items including star salaries, production, and distribution costs can be smartly negotiated and set. 

\newpage
## 1.2 Research Question

The success or failure of a movie depends on a variety of different factors: star cast, cast gender, budget, and title. With the breadth of data available today, making accurate revenue predictions is extremely difficult. However, we do have many data science tools and methodologies at our disposal to help in attempting to make movie revenue predictions. 

Our research question is:\
\
_How the Lead actor's gender affect a movie's gross revenue?_
\

In this study we will explore the relationship between the following features, cast gender, budget, and title. First, to harness the power of the regression testing harness we engineered three linear regression models to predict the movie revenue. Second, we engineer the model using various data features. We iterated over different features including the following extracted features, cast gender, budget, and title. Third, we collected various types of datasets from different freely open sources. We then joined and sanitized the data for inspections and prediction modeling. 

# 2. Description of the Data and Research Design

```{r , out.width="70%", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# After you have presented the introduction and the concepts that are under investigation, what data are you going to use to answer the questions? What type of research design are you using? What type of models are you going to estimate, and what goals do you have for these models?  
```  

We use two datasets for our analysis:

**IMDb dataset** ([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies)):
For this dataset, the data that we are interested in are the movie title, budget, and gross. Budget and Gross are in US dollar.

**Movie roles by gender** ([url](https://www.kaggle.com/code/martinellis/exploration-of-movie-roles-by-gender/notebook)):
This dataset has the gender info for movie actors. The source has instructions on how to execute R code to parse the original data file, which has data in JSON format, and convert it into CSV format that can be imported to R studio. The values of gender is either a value of 2 for "Male", or 1 for "Female".

With this two datasets, we then perform an inner-join on them by their movie lead actor name to generate a single dataset that has all the movie info plus lead actor's gender info.

Before we perform our analysis, we also clean up the data by removing all the entries that have empty values for the fields that we are interested (budget, gross). The final dataset has over 5000 rows of movie data.

## 2a. Data Characteristics
In this section we take a look at the data characteristics for our variables that we are interested and see if there is any need to perform cleanup or transformation before we build our models.\
\

```{r , out.width="70%", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(movies_dataset, aes(budget)) + 
  geom_histogram(position="dodge", alpha=0.8) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Movie Budgets")+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = comma)
```
\
Movie Budget is highly skewed to the left which means most movies have relatively low budget, and there are only a few movies that have really high budget.
\
```{r , out.width="70%", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(movies_dataset, aes(gross)) + 
  geom_histogram(position="dodge", alpha=0.8) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Movie Gross Earnings")+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = comma)
```
\
Movie Gross Earnings has similar characteristics as the budget, also highly skewed to the low end.
\
```{r , out.width="70%", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# ggplot(movies_dataset, aes(runtime)) + 
#   geom_histogram(position="dodge", alpha=0.8) +
#   ggtitle("Distribution of Movie Runtime")+
#   scale_x_continuous(labels = comma)
# \
# Most movies have runtime under 150 minutes.
# \
```

```{r , out.width="70%", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(movies_dataset, aes(gender)) + 
  geom_histogram(position="dodge", alpha=0.8, binwidth = 0.5) +
  ggtitle("Lead Actor's Gender")

```
\
In this histogram that shows the number of Male versus Female Lead Actor. The value "2.0" represent 'Male', and you can see that there are much more Male lead actors in our movie dataset.
\

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(movies_dataset, aes(title_unique_score)) + 
  geom_histogram(position="dodge", alpha=0.8) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Movie Title Unique Score")+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = comma)

```
\
The title unique score is skewed to the low end.
\


```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
#movies_cast_gender %>% group_by(gender, gender_str) %>% summarise(count_genders = n()) %>% arrange(desc(count_genders))
# movies_cast_gender %>% group_by(genre, genre_) %>% summarise(count_genres = n()) %>% arrange(desc(count_genres))
# movies_cast_gender %>% group_by(rating, rating_) %>% summarise(count_rating = n()) %>% arrange(desc(count_rating))
# 
# movies_cast_gender %>% group_by(director, director_) %>% summarise(count_directors = n()) %>% arrange(desc(count_directors))
# movies_cast_gender %>% group_by(writer) %>% summarise(count_writers = n()) %>% arrange(desc(count_writers))
# movies_cast_gender %>% group_by(star) %>% summarise(count_stars = n()) %>% arrange(desc(count_stars))
# movies_cast_gender %>% group_by(country) %>% summarise(count_country = n()) %>% arrange(desc(count_country))
# movies_cast_gender %>% group_by(company) %>% summarise(count_company = n()) %>% arrange(desc(count_company))

# 3. Modeling

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# You will next build a set of models to investigate your research question, documenting your decisions. Here are some things to keep in mind during your model building process:
# 
# 1. *What do you want to measure*? Make sure you identify one, or a few, variables that will allow you to derive conclusions relevant to your research question, and include those variables in all model specifications. How are the variables that you will be modeling distributed? Provide enough context and information about your data for your audience to understand whatever model results you will eventually present. 
# 2. What [covariates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables#Statistics_synonyms) help you achieve your modeling goals? Are there problematic covariates?  either due to *collinearity*, or because they will absorb some of a causal effect you want to measure?
# 3. What *transformations*, if any, should you apply to each variable? These transformations might reveal linearities in the data, make our results relevant, or help us meet model assumptions.
# 4. Are your choices supported by exploratory data analysis (*EDA*)? You will likely start with some general EDA to *detect anomalies* (missing values, top-coded variables, etc.). From then on, your EDA should be interspersed with your model building. Use visual tools to *guide* your decisions. You can also leverage statistical *tests* to help assess whether variables, or groups of variables, are improving model fit.
# 
# At the same time, it is important to remember that you are not trying to create one perfect model. You will create several specifications, giving the reader a sense of how robust (or sensitive) your results are to modeling choices, and to show that you're not just cherry-picking the specification that leads to the largest effects.
# 
# At a minimum, you need to estimate at least three model specifications: 
# 
# The first model you include should include *only the key variables* you want to measure. These variables might be transformed, as determined by your EDA, but the model should include the absolute minimum number of covariates (usually zero or one covariate that is so crucial it would be unreasonable to omit it).
# 
# Additional models should each be defensible, and should continue to tell the story of how product features contribute to product success. This might mean including additional right-hand side features to remove omitted variable bias identified by your casual theory; or, instead, it might mean estimating a model that examines a related concept of success, or a model that investigates a heterogeneous effect. These models, and your modeling process should be defensible, incremental, and clearly explained at all points.
# 
# Your goal is to choose models that encircle the space of reasonable modeling choices, and to give an overall understanding of how these choices impact results.
```

## 3.1 Base Model: Female indicator and Gross Earnings
In order to answer our research question, we build our first model with 'Gross earnings' as our outcome variable and 'Female Indicator' as our feature variable. A female indicator is a binary flag which has the value of 0 or 1. When it is '1', it means that the lead actor of that movie is a female. We generate this indicator by processing the 'gender' data and add a new column in the dataset to store the resulting indicator.
\
Moreover, since the Gross earning is highly skewed, we also apply Log transformation to it in our first model. So the model becomes this:
\
\
_Log(Gross) = Female_indicator_
\

## 3.2 Second Model: Adding Movie Budget
For the second model we are trying to improve the fitness of the model by introducing a feature variable that has a strong correlation with our outcome varable which is gross earnings. From our EDA we generated a correlation heatmap to show the correlations between variables. We identify that the 'budget' variable has the strongest correlation with gross earnings. This also makes sense in reality, since a bigger budge movies are expected to have higher gross earnings in order to generate profits for the production companies. Of course big budget doesn't guarantee a big payout. Success of a movie still depends on other factors, like the story itself.
\
\
The Budget data is also highly skewed, so we apply Log transformation to it in our second model as well:
\
\
_Log(Gross) = Female_indicator + Log(Budget)_
\


## 3.3 Third Model: Adding Title Uniqueness
We are also interested to find out if the movie title has effects on gross earning. First, we build a simple model that uses only 'title_unique_score' as the feature variable against gross earnings.

The title uniqueness score has a very low p-value less that 0.01. It seems that title uniqueness does affect the gross earning. The coefficient of the 'Log(title_unique_score)' is positive, meaning a high score will help increase gross earnings. The R-square value is very low, which indicates that this model doesn't fit well with the data.

So we will introduce this new feature into our 3rd model:
\
\
_Log(Gross) = Female_indicator + Log(Budget) + Log(Title_Unqiue_Score)_
\


\newpage

# 4. Results

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
model_1 <- lm(log(gross) ~ female_indicator, movies_dataset)
model_2 <- lm(log(gross) ~ female_indicator + log(budget), movies_dataset)
model_3 <- lm(log(gross) ~ female_indicator + log(budget) + log(title_unique_score), movies_dataset)

stargazer(
  model_1,
  model_2,
  model_3,
  header=FALSE,
  type='latex',
  se = list(get_robust_se(model_1), get_robust_se(model_2), get_robust_se(model_3) )
  )

```

In the first model, we see that the p-value of the "Female_indictor" is less than 0.01 which means there is significant evidence that female gender has effects on "Log(Gross)". The coefficient is a negative value, meaning that a movie with a female lead actor actually brings less gross earnings than a movie with a male lead actor. The coefficient value of -0.20 means that it will be 20% less on gross if a movie uses a female lead actor. The adjusted R-squared is 0.002 which is low, meaning that at this point the model doesn't fit the data really well. The next model we will focus on improving the R-square by introducing other covariates that can help explain more of the model.

After introducing the budget into our second model, we see that both Female_indicator and Budget have a low p-value. This indicates that both of these feature variables are statistically significant in determining the gross earnings of a movie. Interestingly, the coefficient of the female_indicator is now a positive value, meaning that a movie with a female lead actor actually brings in more money (about 12% more) than a movie with male lead actor. Most importantly, the R-square has hugely improved, to almost 50%.

For our third model, it seems that this feature doesn't really make much difference on our model. Coefficients of the other feature variables don't change much, so as the R-square value.

Based on these statistics, we see that using a female lead actor in a movie does help bringing more gross earnings in a significant way. The effect on gross earnings is about 11-12%, which is substantial.


```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE,}
# You should display all of your model specifications in a regression table, using a package like [`stargazer`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stargazer/vignettes/stargazer.pdf) to format your output. It should be easy for the reader to find the coefficients that represent key effects near the top of the regression table, and scan horizontally to see how they change from specification to specification. Make sure that you display the most appropriate standard errors in your table.
# 
# In your text, comment on both *statistical significance and practical significance*. You may want to include statistical tests besides the standard t-tests for regression coefficients. Here, it is important that you make clear to your audience the practical significance of any model results. How should the product change as a result of what you have discovered? Are there limits to how much change you are proposing? What are the most important results that you have discovered, and what are the least important? 
```


# 5. Limitations of your Model 

## 5.1 Large-Sample Assumptions
Since our analysis is based on a dataset with more than 5000 entries, we can use the large-sample assumptions.

### 5.1.1 Independent and Identically Distributed (I.I.D.)
Our dataset doesn't satisfy the IID assumption. Our dataset has movies between year 1980 and 2020 scraped from IMDb. For movies that are actually in the same series, like 'Star Wars' or "Mission Impossible", their data will not be independent.

### 5.1.2 Unique BLP Exists
We want to make sure that no variables are perfectly collinear with any one of the other variables. From the correlation heatmap below, we can see that perfect collinearity only happens at the diagonal of the matrix which has all 1's and no where else. Also, while building our model, R didn't drop any variables considered to cause perfect collinearity with any other variables.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE,}

movies_dataset_model <- movies_dataset[, c("gross", "budget", "female_indicator", "title_unique_score")]

movies_cor <- cor(movies_dataset_model)
movies_cor<-round(movies_cor,3)
# movies_cor

library(reshape2)
melted_movies_cor <- melt(movies_cor)

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = melted_movies_cor, aes(x=Var1, y=Var2, fill=value)) +
  geom_tile() + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "grey", high = "black") +
  geom_text(aes(Var2, Var1, label = value), color = "white", size = 6) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 1, hjust=1))
```


```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE,}
# As a team, evaluate all of the large sample model assumptions. However, you do not necessarily want to discuss every assumption in your report. Instead, highlight any assumption that might pose significant problems for your analysis. For any violations that you identify, describe the statistical consequences. If you are able to identify any strategies to mitigate the consequences, explain these strategies. 
# 
# Note that you may need to change your model specifications in response to violations of the large sample model. 
```

\newpage

## 5.2 Omitted Variables

### 5.2.1 Intentional Omitted Variables

![Intentional Omitted Variables]("omitted_variables.png")

The variables that are available in our dataset but are omitted in building our models are:

* Genre
* Director
* Writer
* Production Company
* Lead Actor
* Country
* Release date
* IMDb rating
* Number of votes in IMDb

Our EDA shows that these variables have low correlation with Gross earnings, so we simply omit them in our models.

### 5.2.2 Unintentional Omitted Variables

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE,}
# What are the most important *omitted variables* that you were not able to measure and include in your analysis? For each variable you name, you should *reason about the direction of bias* caused by omitting this variable and whether the omission of this variable calls into question the core results you are reporting. What data could you collect that would resolve any omitted variables bias? 
```

There are other variables not available in our dataset that might have causal effects on a movie's gross earnings.

* Film distribution platforms
* In theater duration
* Story of the movie
* Acting skills of the cast


# 6. Conclusion

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE,}
# Make sure that you end your report with a discussion that distills key insights from your estimates and addresses your research question. 
```
